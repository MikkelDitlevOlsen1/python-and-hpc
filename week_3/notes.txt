waht is preformans and how to measure
    wall-clock Time (time it takes to run the code stopwatch)
        to finde wall-clock Time
        ```bash
        t=time()
        s=sum(x)
        t=time()-t
        ``` 
    
    CPU time (how much time did the CPU work) a bit lees then wall clock time for singel trhed but more for paralel work
    

    Flop/s (how fast did the CPU work) (hard to mesarue must look at code)
        Floting point operations/second 
        Flops/s = #flops/wall time
        
        normaly go time over time doing to mermary haracy (caches)


memory herarchies
    memory is slower then Procesors why we use cache
 -- caches
    there can be a lot of catches where l1 is farster then l2 so therefor it slow down when l1 is full it need to use l2
    a cache is a small mini ram so we can run farster
    when ever we move stuf from ram or hardisk to cache we move a cahe line (8 bits) it does this aoutmatick if a number is not in cahche it move it to it whit its cache line
    cache miss if when you look for a number in the cache but its not there (it will then look in l2 if not there look in ram and move it up)
